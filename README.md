The Student Information System is a database management project developed to efficiently manage and organize student related data in an educational institution. It allows administrators and staff to add, edit, delete, and search student records, while students can securely log in to view their personal details, academic performance, attendance, and fee information. The system includes role-based access for Admin, Staff, and Students, with secure login/logout functionality and dashboards tailored for each role. It ensures data consistency, accuracy, and easy retrieval using structured database queries, making academic administration more streamlined, paperless, and user-friendly.
